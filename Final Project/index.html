<h1>Why Should You Adopt?</h1>


<p>

	 You should adopt pets for multiples reasons. First of, you can give them the love that they never had.
<br> Secondly, they can protect you and your family.
<br> Moreover, you should adopt if you are feeling lonely because once you adopt a pet you will have someone that is waiting for you at home.
<br> Nowadays there are dogs out there that have been mistreated, abused and used for street fights. They have never received a single drop of love or affection.
<br> Most people don't know but you can actually adopt a pet easily, just look up adoption centers on your area and you can go and decide which one do you want to adopt.
<br> In general I'd rather adopt than pay for a pet because in that way I can help an animal that has never in his life imagined what love feels like.
